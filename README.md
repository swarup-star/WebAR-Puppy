## What is this?

This is a cool AR (augmented reality) project that shows a 3D puppy on your screen when you point your camera at a picture of a dog. You can spin the puppy with your finger and see info about it.

## Cool things it does:

- Works in your web browser - no app to download!
- You can rotate the puppy by touching it
- Tap the puppy to see information panels
- Shows pictures in a slideshow

## How to use it:

1. Visit the [demo link](https://reliable-melba-93be87.netlify.app/)
2. Let the website use your camera
3. Point your camera at the dog picture (shown above)
4. When the puppy appears:
   - Swipe to spin it around
   - Tap on it to see info
   - Use arrow buttons to see different pictures
   - Press X to close the panels

## What I used to make it:

- THREE.js for 3D stuff
- MindAR for the augmented reality part
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## To run it on your computer:

1. Download all the files
2. Open a command prompt in the folder
3. Type: `python -m http.server 8000`
4. Open a web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

## Files in the project:

- `index.html`: The main page
- `app.js`: All the code that makes it work
- `app.css`: Makes everything look nice
- `pup.glb`: The 3D puppy model
- `dog.webp`: The picture you need to scan

## AI Usage in this Project:

I used AI tools for:
- Writing this documentation to make it easy to understand
- Solving coding errors when things didn't work right
- Generating images for the project
- Improving the code organization and structure

## Works on:

- Most smartphones (iPhone and Android)
- Tablets
- Computers with a camera

Thanks for checking out my WebAR Puppy project!
- All testers who provided feedback during development

## AI Usage

I used artificial intelligence (AI) to help with this project:
- Documentation: AI helped me write this README and other project documents
- Error Solving: AI helped me fix bugs and coding problems
- Image Generation: Some of the images used were created with AI tools
